    "It is worth noting before we go any further that none of this is binding. Adapt this to suit you and your project (conservatively), this is here give you something that works for a general project to save you time, not tell you how to work.\n",

    "We can use a standard folder structure so that it is easy to understand where everything is. For this we use cookiecutter.\n",

    "\n",
    "- It gives us a workable structure in one go and saves time meaning we can get on with doing actual work\n",
    "- It encourages good practice and a sensible workflow with modular code, explorations and outputs\n",

    "\n",
    "You can have a look a documentation discussing this structure here:http://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/#cookiecutter-data-science but there are some important principles that this follows below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data is immutable\n",
    "This allows your work to be replicated if someone has the original data and the code that processes the data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebooks are for hacky exploration and outputs\n",
    "They are not that great for the heavy lifting of processing your data science projects. For that use .py files as you can import these into multiple notebooks for reuse and document them as well as use tools like pyflake and unittest to check your code and make sure it is of high quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis is linear and deterministic\n",
    "What this means is there are a number of steps to follow in a set order to get your outputs build from the environment.  If your code is adequately documented and well organised, then anyone else should be able to follow these steps to run your analysis and replicate your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Always use a virtual environment \n",
    "This is to avoid the \"it used to work\" or \"it works on my machine\" problems. Basically if you want to share your code or use it again in future, use an environment. I use pipenv as it wraps up pip and virtualenv into one package which I think makes things easy and simple to use. This should ensure you are using the same package versions in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Change the layout conservatively\n",
    "Do you really need to change the structure? really really? Remember any change makes your project more opaque and less understandable as it is a devates from what people might expect by reading the cookiecutter documentation here."
